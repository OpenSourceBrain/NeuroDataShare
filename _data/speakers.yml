  title: The Low-Power Mode of neocortex - energy use and coding precision during food scarcity
  abstract: How have animals managed to maintain metabolically expensive brains given the volatile and fleeting availability of calories in the natural world? I will present recent results in support of two strategies that involve - 1) an implementation of energy-efficient neural coding, enabling the brain to operate at reduced energy costs, and 2) an efficient use of costly neural resources during food scarcity. These results reveal metabolic state-dependent mechanisms by which the mammalian cortex regulates coding precision to preserve energy in times of food scarcity.

  title: The Neurodata Without Borders ecosystem for FAIR neurophysiology data
  abstract: "The neurophysiology of cells and tissues are monitored electrophysiologically and optically in diverse experiments and species, ranging from flies to humans. Understanding the brain requires integration of data across this diversity, and thus these data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). In this presentation we will describe with Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) the design and implementation for an open standard for neurophysiology data. The open-source NWB software defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable, components of a data language. We will discuss the NWB data standard and software and provide an overview of the broader NWB software ecosystem of community visualization and analysis tools."

  title: Code plus data - Model-free identification of neural encoding
  abstract: Brains are not engineered solutions to a well-defined problem but arose through selective pressure acting on random variation. It is therefore unclear how well a model chosen by an experimenter can relate neural activity to experimental conditions. Here we developed “Model-free identification of neural encoding (MINE)” which combines convolutional neural networks with Taylor decomposition approaches to understand and comprehensively characterize the mapping from task features to activity. I will introduce MINE and discuss challenges related to sharing the generated method and data and how we think that sharing analysis code may increase data accessibility.

  title: Managing and displaying multiscale data - lessons from simulations
  abstract: In a perfect world, we would like datasets that represent the activity and properties of every functional component of our experimental systems. This situation has already come true in simulations, as we have access to every parameter and state variable of the model. This overabundance of data presents its own set of design problems for data integration, sharing and visualization, especially for multiscale models that span molecules to networks. I will discuss how we've implemented formats and tools to do this. I suggest that the development of these tools may provide guideposts for managing richer experimental datasets which incorporate multimodal and multiscale data.

  title: Connectomics analyses for the formation and plasticity of neural networks 
  abstract: Animals may maintain, update, or alter behaviors as their circuitries undergo developmental and environmental changes. The transition process of the C. elegans nervous system from its juvenile to mature configuration is a good experimental platform to reveal rules that govern the form and plasticity of neural networks. We have combined connectomics, optogenetics, and modeling approaches to address how the relationship between the C. elegans’ structural and functional circuitry changes during development. These analyses implicate multiple maturation strategies to serve different etiology needs.
